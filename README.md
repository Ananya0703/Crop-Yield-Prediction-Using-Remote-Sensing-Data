[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive solution for Crop Yield Prediction using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and remote sensing data. It empowers farmers, agricultural experts and stakeholders with valuable insights into crop yield forecasts, allowing for better planning and decision-making in the agricultural sector.

## Data Sources

- **GridMET Weather Data**: We have utilized weather data from the GridMET dataset spanning from the year 1980 to 2020 to enhance our predictive models.
  - https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html

- **USDA Quick Stats**: We also incorporate data from USDA Quick Stats for crop yield information, providing a valuable additional source for our predictive models.

## Python Package Deployement
- **netcdf-unpacker**: To simplify working with NetCDF files, we've developed and deployed an open-source library called `netcdf-unpacker`, which is available on PyPi.
  - https://pypi.org/project/netcdf-unpacker/
  - https://github.com/Ananya0703/NetCDF_Unpacker

## Project Focus

This project primarily focuses on accurate crop yield predictions for two major crops:

- **Corn**: Providing detailed and reliable predictions for corn crops.

- **Soybean**: Offering insights into soybean crop yield predictions.

## Project Highlights

- State-Wise Crop Yield Prediction for the US Corn Belt: Our models have been designed to provide accurate crop yield predictions for the US Corn Belt states.

- Ongoing Project: We're continuously improving and expanding this project, with the next goal being county-wise crop yield prediction.

- Streamlit Web Application: The model has been deployed as a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, making it easy for users to obtain real-time crop yield predictions and visualize the results.

## Streamlit Web Application

Explore crop yield predictions and visualize insights with our user-friendly Streamlit web application. Get real-time forecasts and gain valuable information for better agricultural planning and decision-making.
